- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikescougs
- 👀 I work for a living in C, C++, HP-UX, Linux, scripting, and Oracle DB/SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Perl, Linux server admin, and secure coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to bring my old web development sites current and stage a portfolio. That means CSS, JavaScript, PHP, with copy and then upgrade so that I become fluent in web services development, testing, and deployment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure if I should put an email or Slack contact here. I'll see the norm and later revise it
