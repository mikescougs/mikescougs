- Hi, I’m @mikescougs
- I work for a living in C, C++, HP-UX, Linux, scripting, and Oracle DB/SQL
- I’m currently learning Python, Linux server admin, git, and secure coding
- I’m looking to bring my old web development sites current and stage a portfolio. That means Python, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, with copy. Then the plan is to upgrade so that I become fluent in web services development, testing, and deployment. A full stack develper. 
- How to reach me ... not sure if I should put an email or Slack contact here. I'll see the norm and later revise it
